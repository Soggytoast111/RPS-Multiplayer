Game exists in a card.

Game begins in a prompt that has a field:
-Enter User Name
-Big button for "Continue"

Continue button uses "push" to firebase to initialize user:
-Pushes "Username"
-Pushes "state" as zero -- to indicate that he's looking for opponent

??Firebase listens for other user with state=0 (don't know how to do this yet)??

Firebase returns "key" of opponent and sets both states to 1 (indicating that they are paired)
-Set "key" to opponent var client-side to track

Prompt player to choose Rock, Paper or Scissors.
-Selection is pushed to firebase

??Firebase listens for opponent's response (don't know how to do this yet)??

Client listens to opponent's "selection" - when it changes it is downloaded to client.

Client calculates winner, updates stats, deletes user key


(CHAT??)
-Create a div in lower right that listens to opponent's change in "chat" variable
-Every change is recorded as a new line (up to 6 lines)
